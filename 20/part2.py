# get the target presents to check for
# divide it by ten to make calculation simpler
# since each elf drops ten presents at each house
# so, house 4 has (10 + 20 + 40) = 70
# which is (1 + 2 + 4) * 10 = 70
# which can be calculated by using (1 + 2 + 4) = 7
#
# the set of presents received by each house
# is the set of factors (unique) including 1 and house no
#
# therefore, by calculating the factors gives us what elves
# will be dropping presents at that house
